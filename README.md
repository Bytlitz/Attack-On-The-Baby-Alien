# Attack-On-The-Baby-Alien
You're stranded on a raft when you wake up from a nap and suddenly you see a baby alien falling down from the sky. You're scared and do not trust the baby alien so you must use your recourses to kill the alien and save the world. Or that's what you assume because you don't know if the baby is to be trusted or not. But regardless you trust your gut.
